Zelda

This could become a 3d clone of the amazing game "The Legend Of Zelda: A Link to the Past"
The Legend of Zelda is one of my amazing game where I can spend my lazy Sunday. ^^

## Screenshots
I took many graphics/textures from [s-cape](http://www.s-cape.biz/), watch his work at [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm8XSdMdJ3w). I also learn an interesting platform and imaginary as I screen-shot the scene. Look [here](http://www.forexchef.de/dab-bank-erfahrungen/).
